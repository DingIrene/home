	<h2>No baking powder?</h2>
	<p> I find that lots of baking recipes require the use of baking powder and although pretty necessary, there is a substitute: baking soda and apple cider vinegar! When mixed together they created a carbonic acid that is great for a natural cleaner! In this case, it is also great for raising the effect in baked goods, but you have to place it in the oven as soon as the compound is made!</p>
	<h2 id="recipe">Recipe</h2>
	<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1&sol;4 a cup of almond flour </li>
		<li>4 tbsp of oat flour</li>
		<li>3 tbsp of flex meal</li>
		<li>Any amount of nuts or seeds 
			<ul>
				<li>Chia seeds</li>
				<li>Pecans</li>
				<li>Peanuts</li>
				<li>Walnuts</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

	</ul>
	<h3>Instructions:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>First preheat the oven to 325&ordm;F</li>

		<li>Add in dry ingredients such as baking soda, almond flour and flex meal.

	</ol>
	<h3>Tips:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Usually you can just stick a toothpick in and when there is no residue on it, then it&apos;s ready!</li>
		<li>If you do not have ground flaxseeds, just add another egg!</li>
		<li>Make sure to place your brownies in the oven right after mixing the ingredients.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Best toppings</h2> 
	<ul>
		<li>Greek yogurt and frozen berries</li> 
		<li>Drizzle of honey along with some chopped up nuts</li> 
		<li>A heaping spoonful of whatever type of nut butter your heart desires</li> 
		<li>Dipping them in a cup of hot milk</li>
		<li>SPRINKLES AND MORE SPRINKLES!*</li>
		<li>Drizzle of some chocolate and powdered sugar*</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Um&hellip; sugar free?</h2>
	<p>You may ask why no heaping cups of sugar? Well this is supposed to be keto and paleo and the shake itself has its own sweetness! If bland brownies are a no no for you, some sweet topping options I have outlined above might help!</p>
